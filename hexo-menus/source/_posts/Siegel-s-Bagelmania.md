Incredibly slow. I entered the restaurant to witness pure chaos. People were scurrying around like a grotesque parody of the Bazaar at Marrakech, no number system, no clear line. Eventually I joined a line that I believed was to place an order. Unfortunately it was only to place pastry orders, not sandwich orders. I then joined the cash register line. Only 3 people long, it took 15 minutes because the cashier (with the name tag "Uncle") was the slowest cashier I've ever seen. As my weariness turned to despair, I was over charged for my Old School (the cash register said "+1.50 Cheddar") but was so concerned about being further mired in the tar of this impersonal bureaucracy I ate the charge. Fortunately I escaped before sinking into the warm blackness and being reclaimed into the earth itself.
