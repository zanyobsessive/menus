UPDATE: We won, this location (on 36th St) is now permanently closed.

Walk into the store. If you see a bearded manager (I believe he works the lunch rush on Mondays and Wednesdays), then prepare for a good soup or sandwich and a decent price. If he isn't there, turn around and run. Don't walk, RUN.

When he is not there, the whole process from ordering to paying to getting your food is an absolute clusterfuck. Part of this is structural - there are random columns in the store in key places (in the middle of the line, in front of the cash registers) that complicates the process. But far more of it is self-imposed by the staff. You immediately walk in and are thoroughly confused because there are at least 3 lines, and it is unclear which line is for which. Once you manage to order your food (which is hard to do because you inevitably waited in the salad line when you wanted soup) you then have no idea when to pay and when your food is up.

Let me tell you about my experience today. I walk in. An employee asks me what I would like to eat. I say a bowl of turkey chili. She then directs me to the soup line by saying "walk up to that sign." So I walk there. Eventually a line forms behind me of other people who were told the same thing. No one takes our order. The other two lines turnover at least twice. I've been sitting there for no fewer than 10 minutes, watching 3 cashiers doing literally nothing (because even though sandwiches and salads are being ordered and prepared the place is such a clusterfuck that my friends in that line don't know where or when to pay), and still no one takes my order for soup. After looking around and asking for help, being rebuffed by the counter employee making sandwiches, I left.

If the bearded manager is there on Mondays and Wednesdays he makes this system work and ensures you get your food in a timely manner. Otherwise, you will either literally never get your food or it will have the taste of anxiety and PTSD from the ordering process.
