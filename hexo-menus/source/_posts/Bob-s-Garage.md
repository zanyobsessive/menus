Do not come here, it was easily one of the worst dining experiences of my life.

I waited a full hour for my sandwich and my companion's salad. During that time I had to wait in a freezing seat (could not have been warmer than 50 degrees in my spot), listen to a visibly drunk 60-something wail along incorrectly to the music, and tolerate the garbage all over the walls. To add insult to injury, the owner came out 40 minutes into our wait saying that it was busy. I stood up and looked, we were one of two tables and one person at the bar was eating. 55 minutes into our wait a waiter teased us with cheese fries (not our order) accidentally and then delivered them to their rightful destination.

Finally, once our food did arrive the toppings on the sandwich were not what my companion ordered, and the food was mediocre.

As a matter of personal taste, I found the wall decor tacky and the music bad and intolerably loud.

If you're 60 and want to get hammered during the day in a cold location and not be alone, come to Bob's Garage. Otherwise go somewhere else!
